# Translation notes

- Give priority to translating the content of the [en.yml](./en.yml) file.
- When adding a new language translation, please modify the logic for getting the default language, the `getDefaultLocale` method is located in [i18n.ts](../plugins/i18n.ts) file.
- Consider the consistency of translated text at the same level, while ensuring accuracy. For example, try to keep the text at the same level of the menu as long as possible.
